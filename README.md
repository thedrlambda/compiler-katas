# compiler-katas

## Introduction
These are small exercises accompanying chapter 7 of my refactoring book [Five Lines of Code](https://www.manning.com/books/five-lines-of-code). 

## How to play
In each source file there is an error described in the top of the file. It is your job to utilize the compiler to expose this error, and fix it.

If any exercises are too difficult to figure out please create an issue for them using the format `[language]/[exercise file] too hard!`. Then we can add more hints to it.

## How to contribute
### A language
If you want to add a new language follow these steps:
1. Create a new folder for the language.
2. Put in the folder a `README.md` file specifying:
   * How to setup the tools needed. 
   * How to compile files.
   * How to run files.

### An exercise
If you want to add an exercise follow these steps:
1. Make a file with the erroneous code.
2. Add a problem description to the top of the file.
3. Submit a pull request including the solution.
